/* The Forge for iPhone and iPad: one window holding the web view that runs
   the_forge.html (DeskView.swift), built the way Inkwell's iPhone and iPad app
   is built: a plain UIKit app and one view controller.

   The window belongs to a SCENE (ShellScene below, also named in Info.plist
   under UIApplicationSceneManifest). Apple's newest Xcode expects every app
   to use scenes: an app that makes its window in the app delegate alone may
   not open when it is built with that Xcode. */
